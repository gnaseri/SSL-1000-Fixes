Suggested Next Steps for 1000 Common Issues in Self-Supervised Learning



Perfect. Here are the **first 20 items (1–20)** in your specified Markdown format:

---

```markdown

## 1. Representation Rank is Low

**Symptoms:**
- Low covariance matrix rank or eigenvalue entropy.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Increase the variance loss coefficient (e.g., in VICReg).
- Increase the embedding dimension (if too narrow).
- Increase batch size to capture more variation.
- Use stronger augmentations to diversify views.
- Add residual connections to encourage diversity in output.

---

## 2. Learned Kernels Are Noisy or Dead

**Symptoms:**
- Kernels look random or many are close to zero.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Lower the learning rate or add gradient clipping.
- Apply weight decay or L1 regularization on conv weights.
- Inspect data normalization — ensure it’s not too aggressive.
- Add initialization schemes like Kaiming or orthogonal init.

---

## 3. Embeddings Collapse or Are Too Similar

**Symptoms:**
- Cosine similarity between features too high, low variance.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Add or strengthen variance regularization.
- Introduce weak asymmetry (e.g., stop gradient, predictor MLP).
- Delay EMA updates if using target networks.
- Increase prediction horizon to reduce trivial matching.

---

## 4. Early Overfitting or Poor Generalization

**Symptoms:**
- Training loss drops, but validation loss rises quickly.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Add dropout, augmentations, or weight decay.
- Check if the model is memorizing shortcuts (like pixel positions).
- Use early stopping or learning rate warmup.
- Reduce model capacity or simplify the task.

---

## 5. Feature Norms Are Highly Uneven

**Symptoms:**
- Some features dominate (e.g., 2–3 features have high norms).

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Normalize features before loss computation.
- Strengthen covariance decorrelation loss.
- Use BatchNorm or LayerNorm in the projector or encoder.
- Consider whitening transforms in analysis.

---

## 6. Covariance Matrix is Highly Correlated

**Symptoms:**
- High off-diagonal energy, many features redundant.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Increase covariance loss coefficient (e.g., VICReg’s nu).
- Reduce use of overlapping augmentations that induce similarity.
- Increase depth or non-linearity in encoder/projector.

---

## 7. Eigenvalues Decay Too Quickly

**Symptoms:**
- Only top 5–10 components explain most variance.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Increase batch diversity or apply feature decorrelation.
- Try orthogonality constraints (e.g., QR loss or mutual information maximization).
- Apply contrastive loss with negative samples.

---

## 8. Prediction Errors Are Localized or Systematic

**Symptoms:**
- Specific regions or classes consistently fail.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Analyze dataset imbalance or sample quality.
- Add local receptive field diversity (e.g., dilated convolutions).
- Train with curriculum or targeted augmentation on weak regions.

---

## 9. Latent Space Visualization Shows Poor Separation

**Symptoms:**
- t-SNE or PCA shows all points clumped together.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Improve augmentation diversity to avoid trivial alignment.
- Add auxiliary tasks (e.g., rotation prediction or jigsaw).
- Increase embedding dimensionality or training time.

---

## 10. Gradient Norms Are Exploding or Vanishing

**Symptoms:**
- Training becomes unstable, NaNs in loss, or gradients ~0.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Use gradient clipping (e.g., clip value or clip norm).
- Check for ReLU dead units — try LeakyReLU or GELU.
- Switch to Adam or RMSprop with proper eps setting.
- Use smaller learning rate or mixed-precision training with GradScaler.

---

## 11. Loss Plateaus Early

**Symptoms:**
- Loss stops improving in early epochs.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Use a learning rate scheduler (StepLR, CosineAnnealing, etc.).
- Add warmup steps at the start.
- Increase model capacity (width or depth).
- Check for data leakage or label noise if applicable.

---

## 12. Very Low Output Variance

**Symptoms:**
- All output features are near zero or constant across samples.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Initialize final layer biases to small non-zero values.
- Use LayerNorm in the output head.
- Regularize output to have unit variance.
- Inspect input normalization and activation function saturation.

---

## 13. Poor Transfer to Downstream Task

**Symptoms:**
- Learned representations perform poorly on supervised tasks.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Introduce task-aware pretext signals.
- Add semantic consistency loss if applicable.
- Use larger datasets or pretrained backbones.
- Fine-tune with a small supervised head to guide representation.

---

## 14. Slow Training

**Symptoms:**
- Training epochs take too long.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Optimize data loading (e.g., increase num_workers, use .pin_memory()).
- Use mixed precision or channels_last format.
- Profile with torch.profiler or nvprof to locate bottlenecks.
- Chunk long sequences if you’re doing sequential modeling.

---

## 15. BatchNorm or LayerNorm Acting Erratically

**Symptoms:**
- Normalization hurts performance or destabilizes training.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Try GroupNorm or InstanceNorm instead.
- Replace with no normalization and tune learning rate carefully.
- If using DDP: ensure BatchNorm is synchronized (SyncBatchNorm).

---

## 16. Representations Are Nearly Identical Across Augmented Views

**Symptoms:**
- High cosine similarity between outputs from different views.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Add stochastic layers (e.g., dropout) before the projector.
- Increase augmentation intensity (e.g., stronger color jitter, masking).
- Add temporal or spatial shift if applicable (e.g., for video or sequence data).

---

## 17. Checkpoint Sizes Are Too Large

**Symptoms:**
- Disk fills up quickly or model is hard to share.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Save only model weights, not full optimizer states.
- Use state_dict() filtering to exclude unneeded buffers.
- Save in float16 if inference is not affected.

---

## 18. Embedding Dimensions Used Unevenly

**Symptoms:**
- Some dimensions are always close to 0, others dominate.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Add uniformity loss or entropy maximization on features.
- Apply decorrelation or orthogonality constraints.
- Use learned positional encoding or non-linear projectors.

---

## 19. EMA Target Doesn’t Help

**Symptoms:**
- EMA-targeted representations don’t stabilize or improve.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Reduce the EMA decay at early epochs (e.g., start at 0.9 and anneal to 0.99).
- Re-initialize EMA with online model every few epochs (experimental).
- Try using fixed encoder instead of EMA to test isolation.

---

## 20. Visualization Metrics Don’t Change Over Epochs

**Symptoms:**
- PCA, cosine similarity, rank, or eigenvalue plots are flat.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Increase the training duration.
- Visualize per-class metrics or region-specific patterns.
- Log metrics after more granular intervals (e.g., every few batches).
- Inspect if loss is still changing — maybe the model is learning but not diversifying representations.
