Suggested Next Steps for 1000 Common Issues in Self-Supervised Learning



## 1. Representation Rank is Low

**Symptoms:**
- Low covariance matrix rank or eigenvalue entropy.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Increase the variance loss coefficient (e.g., in VICReg).
- Increase the embedding dimension (if too narrow).
- Increase batch size to capture more variation.
- Use stronger augmentations to diversify views.
- Add residual connections to encourage diversity in output.

## 2. Learned Kernels Are Noisy or Dead

**Symptoms:**
- Kernels look random or many are close to zero.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Lower the learning rate or add gradient clipping.
- Apply weight decay or L1 regularization on conv weights.
- Inspect data normalization — ensure it’s not too aggressive.
- Add initialization schemes like Kaiming or orthogonal init.

---

## 3. Embeddings Collapse or Are Too Similar

**Symptoms:**
- Cosine similarity between features too high, low variance.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Add or strengthen variance regularization.
- Introduce weak asymmetry (e.g., stop gradient, predictor MLP).
- Delay EMA updates if using target networks.
- Increase prediction horizon to reduce trivial matching.

---

## 4. Early Overfitting or Poor Generalization

**Symptoms:**
- Training loss drops, but validation loss rises quickly.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Add dropout, augmentations, or weight decay.
- Check if the model is memorizing shortcuts (like pixel positions).
- Use early stopping or learning rate warmup.
- Reduce model capacity or simplify the task.

---

## 5. Feature Norms Are Highly Uneven

**Symptoms:**
- Some features dominate (e.g., 2–3 features have high norms).

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Normalize features before loss computation.
- Strengthen covariance decorrelation loss.
- Use BatchNorm or LayerNorm in the projector or encoder.
- Consider whitening transforms in analysis.

---

## 6. Covariance Matrix is Highly Correlated

**Symptoms:**
- High off-diagonal energy, many features redundant.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Increase covariance loss coefficient (e.g., VICReg’s nu).
- Reduce use of overlapping augmentations that induce similarity.
- Increase depth or non-linearity in encoder/projector.

---

## 7. Eigenvalues Decay Too Quickly

**Symptoms:**
- Only top 5–10 components explain most variance.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Increase batch diversity or apply feature decorrelation.
- Try orthogonality constraints (e.g., QR loss or mutual information maximization).
- Apply contrastive loss with negative samples.

---

## 8. Prediction Errors Are Localized or Systematic

**Symptoms:**
- Specific regions or classes consistently fail.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Analyze dataset imbalance or sample quality.
- Add local receptive field diversity (e.g., dilated convolutions).
- Train with curriculum or targeted augmentation on weak regions.

---

## 9. Latent Space Visualization Shows Poor Separation

**Symptoms:**
- t-SNE or PCA shows all points clumped together.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Improve augmentation diversity to avoid trivial alignment.
- Add auxiliary tasks (e.g., rotation prediction or jigsaw).
- Increase embedding dimensionality or training time.

---

## 10. Gradient Norms Are Exploding or Vanishing

**Symptoms:**
- Training becomes unstable, NaNs in loss, or gradients ~0.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Use gradient clipping (e.g., clip value or clip norm).
- Check for ReLU dead units — try LeakyReLU or GELU.
- Switch to Adam or RMSprop with proper eps setting.
- Use smaller learning rate or mixed-precision training with GradScaler.
