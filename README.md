**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Apply feature alignment regularization (keep SSL features close).
- Use low learning rate or freeze early layers during downstream phase.
- Add distillation loss from pretraining version of model.

## 185. Model Can’t Handle Very Long Sequences (>1024 tokens)

**Symptoms:**
- Performance drops or memory explodes when sequence length increases.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Use chunking or sliding window attention (e.g., Longformer, BigBird).
- Add recurrence modules (e.g., Transformer-XL memory caching).
- Train with truncated sequences and finetune on full-length.

---

## 186. One Augmentation View Always Dominates Representation

**Symptoms:**
- Contrastive pairs are asymmetric; only one view contributes useful features.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Equalize augmentation difficulty and diversity between views.
- Swap encoder inputs during training (view_a → encoder_b).
- Track and plot view-specific gradient magnitudes to monitor imbalance.

---

## 187. Encoder Reaches Capacity Limit Early

**Symptoms:**
- Representations saturate even though loss continues improving.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Add extra bottleneck layers or increase depth of encoder.
- Use wider embedding layers or more channels.
- Add residual connections to prevent dead-end compression.

---

## 188. Model Exhibits Global Collapse Despite Balanced Loss Terms

**Symptoms:**
- Even with VC regularization or contrastive loss, collapse still occurs.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Monitor feature norms, rank, entropy during training in real time.
- Add adaptive scaling of regularization losses (e.g., scale VC by cosine sim drop).
- Add stochastic gradient skip connections to prevent collapse cascades.

---

## 189. Contrastive Features Become Memory-Dependent

**Symptoms:**
- SSL model performs well only when memory banks or queues are active.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Reduce reliance on memory by increasing batch size.
- Use momentum encoders (BYOL, MoCo) to stabilize without external queues.
- Simulate large batches with cross-GPU negative sharing.

---

## 190. Features Drift Between Validation and Training Modes

**Symptoms:**
- Latents behave differently between training and evaluation (e.g., in batchnorm mode switch).

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Use GroupNorm or LayerNorm for consistency across modes.
- Track mean/std statistics of outputs across train vs. eval.
- Add validation-time alignment loss to correct this drift.

---

## 191. Backbone Weights Oscillate or Diverge Under Joint Objectives

**Symptoms:**
- Joint SSL + supervised training causes encoder instability.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Apply loss scheduling (e.g., pretrain SSL first, then gradually mix supervision).
- Use multi-head architecture, each head for one task.
- Detach gradients between conflicting branches.

---

## 192. Prototypes Collapse to Uniform Direction

**Symptoms:**
- All cluster centers or anchors in the latent space collapse toward the same point or line.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Apply orthogonal constraint or repulsive prototype loss.
- Periodically re-initialize prototypes randomly or based on KMeans.
- Enforce entropy-maximizing soft assignment in cluster heads.

---

## 193. Model Underperforms on Edge Cases Despite High Average Accuracy

**Symptoms:**
- Accuracy good overall, but fails on rare or ambiguous inputs.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Track and log performance per input cluster or difficulty bin.
- Use confidence-aware losses or hard-negative oversampling.
- Add a secondary head trained only on difficult examples.

---

## 194. Embedding Space Shows “Grid-Like” Artifacts or Clumping

**Symptoms:**
- t-SNE or PCA shows unnatural geometric artifacts (e.g., grids, bands).

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Avoid strong weight tying or positional encoding that enforces structure.
- Increase activation noise or dropout during training.
- Add feature-space regularizers that penalize repeating distances.

---

## 195. Loss Minimizes But Downstream Metrics Oscillate

**Symptoms:**
- Training loss is stable or decreasing, but eval metrics jump or regress.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Visualize representation trajectories or cosine similarity over time.
- Apply temporal consistency or variance stabilization losses.
- Reassess whether loss aligns with target metric — try replacing or combining losses.

---

## 196. Features Are Predictable But Not Linearly Separable

**Symptoms:**
- Model learns informative representations, but linear probe performs poorly.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Try kernelized probes to test non-linear separability.
- Replace linear head with MLP probe and visualize accuracy gain.
- Add auxiliary heads to promote linearly discriminative subspaces.

---

## 197. Early Layers Remain Untrained Despite Good Loss

**Symptoms:**
- Final loss is low but shallow layers show no gradient update or learning.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Use layer-wise learning rate scaling (higher for early layers).
- Add skip connections to increase flow to shallow layers.
- Penalize shallow layer inactivity (e.g., activation sparsity loss).

---

## 198. Feature Representations Are Temporally Incoherent

**Symptoms:**
- Features change abruptly between adjacent frames/timesteps.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Apply temporal smoothness loss or contrastive coherence regularization.
- Use frame prediction or interpolation as an auxiliary task.
- Normalize feature velocity (change rate) across batches.

---

## 199. SSL Loss Improves But Few Embedding Axes Are Used

**Symptoms:**
- Training loss drops, but PCA shows only 5–10 active axes.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Add variance loss across all dimensions (e.g., VICReg-style).
- Penalize feature sparsity in covariance matrix or SVD spectrum.
- Consider axis-specific decorrelation regularizers.

---

## 200. Model Always Predicts Near the Origin in Embedding Space

**Symptoms:**
- Final vectors have small magnitude or hover around zero vector.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Normalize embeddings and apply L2 norm constraints.
- Add feature norm target (e.g., unit norm or learned scale).
- Inspect output activation functions — consider removing or replacing.
